# Modelica3D #

Modelica3D is a lightweight, platform independent 3D-visualisation library for Modelica.

The original version of Modelica3D comes from https://mlcontrol.uebb.tu-berlin.de/redmine/projects/modelica3d-public.
That project has not been updated in while and does not work in [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org).
This fork works in the Modelica Standard Library 3.2.1 ([MSL 3.2.1](https://modelica.org)) and also no longer needs a patched standard library.
