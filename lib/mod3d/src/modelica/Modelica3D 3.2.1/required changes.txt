To use Modelica3D with Modelica 3.2.1, copy this package.mo to ModelicaServices/Modelica3D/package.mo along with modbus and modcount (as in the old version)

Additionally, the model Shape

{{{
    package Animation "Models and functions for 3-dim. animation"
      extends Modelica.Icons.Package;
    model Shape
        "Different visual shapes with variable size; all data have to be set as modifiers (see info layer)"
      extends
          Modelica.Utilities.Internal.PartialModelicaServices.Animation.PartialShape;
}}}

has to be extended from Modelica3D.PartialShape, i.e. it becomes

{{{
    package Animation "Models and functions for 3-dim. animation"
      extends Modelica.Icons.Package;
    model Shape
        "Different visual shapes with variable size; all data have to be set as modifiers (see info layer)"
      extends
          Modelica.Utilities.Internal.PartialModelicaServices.Animation.PartialShape;
      extends
          ModelicaServices.Modelica3D.PartialShape;		  
}}}
